        <h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2>
        <p>
          A healthy diet is vital in maintaining overall health, including brain
          health. Incorporating brain-boosting foods into your diet can provide
          essential nutrients and antioxidants. These include fruits,
          vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and foods rich in omega-3
          fatty acids. Avoiding processed and sugary foods is also recommended.
        </p>

      <div class="measure">
        <h2>Lifestyle Modifications</h2>
        <p>
          Regular exercise has been shown to have numerous benefits for brain
          health. Engaging in physical activities like walking, jogging, or
          cycling can improve blood flow to the brain and help reduce the risk
          of tumours. Maintaining a healthy weight through a balanced diet and
          regular exercise is also essential. Additionally, managing stress
          levels and getting adequate sleep are crucial for overall well-being.
        </p>

      <div class="measure">
        <h2>Environmental Factors</h2>
        <p>
          Minimising exposure to environmental toxins can help reduce the risk
          of brain tumours. This includes avoiding or limiting exposure to
          chemicals, such as pesticides and solvents, and ensuring proper
          ventilation in living and working spaces. While research on the
          potential risks associated with cell phones and Wi-Fi radiation is
          ongoing, using hands-free devices and reducing screen time may provide
          peace of mind.
