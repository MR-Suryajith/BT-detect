        <h2>Surgery</h2>
        <p>
          Surgery is often the first step in treating brain tumors. The goal of
          surgery is to remove as much of the tumor as possible while preserving
          brain function. In some cases, the entire tumor may be removed. In
          others, only part of the tumor can be safely removed.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="treatment-section">
        <h2>Radiation Therapy</h2>
        <p>
          Radiation therapy uses high-energy rays to kill cancer cells. It may
          be used before or after surgery, or as the primary treatment for
          tumors that cannot be surgically removed. Radiation therapy can be
          targeted directly at the tumor to minimize damage to surrounding
          healthy tissue.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="treatment-section">
        <h2>Chemotherapy</h2>
        <p>
          Chemotherapy involves the use of drugs to kill cancer cells. It may be
          used alone or in combination with surgery and/or radiation therapy.
          Chemotherapy drugs can be taken orally or injected into the
          bloodstream, allowing them to travel throughout the body to reach
          cancer cells.
