      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Brain tumors can cause a variety of symptoms, depending on their size,
        location, and rate of growth. Some symptoms may develop gradually, while
        others may appear suddenly. It's essential to recognize the signs of a
        brain tumor and seek medical attention if you experience any concerning
        symptoms.
      </p>

      <h2>Common Symptoms</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Headaches:</strong> Persistent and severe headaches are a
          common symptom of brain tumors. These headaches may worsen over time
          and may not respond to typical headache remedies.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Seizures:</strong> Seizures, which are sudden and uncontrolled
          electrical disturbances in the brain, can occur in people with brain
          tumors. Seizures may involve convulsions, muscle jerking, or loss of
          consciousness.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Changes in Vision:</strong> Brain tumors can affect vision,
          leading to blurred vision, double vision, or loss of peripheral
          vision. Some people may also experience seeing flashes of light or
          other visual disturbances.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Memory Loss:</strong> Cognitive changes, including memory loss
          and difficulty concentrating, may occur in individuals with brain
          tumors. These changes can affect daily functioning and quality of
          life.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Personality Changes:</strong> Brain tumors can cause changes
          in personality, mood swings, or alterations in behavior. These changes
          may be subtle or more pronounced, depending on the tumor's location
          and impact on brain function.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Weakness or Numbness:</strong> Weakness or numbness in the
          arms, legs, or face may occur due to pressure on the nerves or
          disruption of brain signals caused by a tumor.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Difficulty Speaking:</strong> Some individuals with brain
          tumors may experience difficulty speaking or understanding speech,
          known as aphasia. This symptom can affect communication and
          interpersonal relationships.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Balance and Coordination Problems:</strong> Brain tumors
          located in areas that control balance and coordination can cause
          difficulties with walking, dizziness, and unsteadiness.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Nausea and Vomiting:</strong> Increased pressure within the
          skull, known as intracranial pressure, can lead to nausea and
          vomiting, particularly in the morning or with changes in position.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Hearing Changes:</strong> Tumors affecting the auditory nerves
          or nearby structures may result in hearing loss, ringing in the ears
          (tinnitus), or other auditory disturbances.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Less Common Symptoms</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Difficulty Swallowing:</strong> Brain tumors located in or
          near the areas responsible for swallowing may cause dysphagia, making
          it challenging to swallow food or liquids.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Changes in Smell or Taste:</strong> Alterations in the sense
          of smell (anosmia) or taste (dysgeusia) may occur due to the tumor's
          effect on the olfactory nerves or brain regions involved in processing
          sensory information.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Sleep Disturbances:</strong> Some individuals with brain
          tumors may experience sleep disturbances, including insomnia,
          excessive sleepiness, or disruptions in sleep patterns.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Altered Sensation:</strong> Brain tumors can cause unusual
          sensations, such as tingling, prickling, or burning sensations in
          various parts of the body, known as paresthesia.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Changes in Bowel or Bladder Function:</strong> Tumors
          affecting the nerves that control bowel and bladder function may
          result in constipation, urinary retention, or urinary incontinence.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Emotional Changes:</strong> Some individuals may experience
          emotional changes, such as depression, anxiety, or irritability, as a
          result of the tumor's impact on brain function and emotional
          regulation.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Motor Weakness:</strong> Progressive weakness or paralysis in
          one or more limbs may occur if the tumor compresses or damages the
          motor pathways in the brain.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Endocrine Dysfunction:</strong> Brain tumors may disrupt
          hormone production and regulation, leading to symptoms such as weight
          gain or loss, changes in menstrual cycles, and abnormal growth
          patterns.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Cognitive Decline:</strong> In some cases, brain tumors can
          cause progressive cognitive decline, affecting memory, attention,
          language, and other aspects of cognitive function.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Behavioral Changes:</strong> Changes in behavior, such as
          impulsivity, disinhibition, or apathy, may occur due to the tumor's
          impact on brain regions involved in decision-making and social
          behavior.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Seeking Medical Attention</h2>
      <p>
