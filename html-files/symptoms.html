      <h1>Decoding Brain Signals</h1>

      <p>
        Some people are trapped within their own minds, able to think and feel
        but unable to express themselves because brain injury or disease has
        damaged their lines of communication with the outside world.
      </p>

      <p>
        As a step toward helping people in such situations communicate,
        scientists at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis have
        demonstrated that they can use light to detect what is going on inside
        someoneâ€™s head. The researchers use LED light beamed from the outside of
        the head inward to detect activity in the area of the brain responsible
        for visual processing, and then decode brain signals to determine what
        the person sees. Accomplishing this feat required the development of
        neuroimaging tools and analysis techniques that move the field a step
        closer to solving the much more complex problem of decoding language.
