      <h1>Risk Factors for Brain Tumor</h1>

      <p>
        A risk factor is anything that increases a person’s chance of developing
        a brain tumor. Although risk factors often influence the development of
        a brain tumor, most do not directly cause a brain tumor. Some people
        with several risk factors never develop a brain tumor, while others with
        no known risk factors do. Knowing your risk factors and talking about
        them with your doctor may help you make more informed decisions. But, at
        this time, there are no known ways to prevent a brain tumor through
        lifestyle changes. Most of the time, the cause of a brain tumor is
        unknown. However, the following factors may raise a person’s risk of
        developing a brain tumor: Age. Brain tumors are more common in children
        and older adults, although people of any age can develop a brain tumor.
        Sex. In general, men are more likely than women to develop a brain
        tumor. However, some specific types of brain tumors, such as meningioma,
        are more common in women. Home and work exposures. Exposure to solvents,
        pesticides, oil products, rubber, or vinyl chloride may increase the
        risk of developing a brain tumor. However, there is not yet scientific
        evidence that supports this possible link. Family history. About 5% of
        brain tumors may be linked to hereditary genetic factors or conditions,
        including Li-Fraumeni syndrome, neurofibromatosis, nevoid basal cell
        carcinoma syndrome, tuberous sclerosis, Turcot syndrome, and von
        Hippel-Lindau disease. Scientists have also found “clusters” of brain
        tumors within some families without a link to these known hereditary
        conditions. Studies are underway to try to find a cause for these
        clusters. Exposure to infections, viruses, and allergens. Infection with
        the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) increases the risk of central nervous
        system (CNS) lymphoma. EBV is more commonly known as the virus that
        causes mononucleosis or “mono.” In other research, high levels of a
        common virus called cytomegalovirus (CMV) have been found in brain tumor
        tissue. The meaning of this finding is being researched. Several types
        of other viruses have been shown to cause brain tumors in research on
        animals. More data are needed to find out if exposure to infections,
        other viruses, or allergens increase the risk of a brain tumor in
        people. Of note, studies have shown that patients with a history of
        allergies or skin conditions have a lower risk of glioma.
        Electromagnetic fields. Most studies evaluating the role of
        electromagnetic fields, such as energy from power lines or from cell
        phone use, show no link to an increased risk of developing a brain tumor
        in adults. Because of conflicting information regarding risk in
        children, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends limiting cell
        phone use and promotes the use of a hands-free headset for both adults
        and children. Race and ethnicity. In the United States, White people are
        more likely to develop gliomas but less likely to develop meningioma
        than Black people. Also, people from northern Europe are more than twice
        as likely to develop a brain tumor as people in Japan. Ionizing
        radiation. Previous treatment to the brain or head with ionizing
        radiation, including x-rays, has been shown to be a risk factor for a
        brain tumor. Head injury and seizures. Serious head trauma has long been
        studied for its relationship to brain tumors. Some studies have shown a
        link between head trauma and meningioma but not between head trauma and
        glioma. A history of seizures has also been linked with brain tumors,
        but because a brain tumor can cause seizures, it is not known if
        seizures increase the risk of brain tumors, if seizures occur because of
        the tumor, or if anti-seizure medication increases the risk. N-nitroso
        compounds. Some studies of diet and vitamin supplementation seem to
        indicate that dietary N-nitroso compounds may raise the risk of both
        childhood and adult brain tumors. Dietary N-nitroso compounds are formed
        in the body from nitrites or nitrates found in some cured meats,
        cigarette smoke, and cosmetics. However, additional research is
        necessary before a definitive link can be established.
