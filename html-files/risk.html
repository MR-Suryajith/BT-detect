      <h1>Risk Factors for Brain Tumor</h1>
      <p>
        A risk factor is anything that increases a person’s chance of developing
        a brain tumor. Although risk factors often influence the development of
        a brain tumor, most do not directly cause a brain tumor. Some people
        with several risk factors never develop a brain tumor, while others with
        no known risk factors do. Knowing your risk factors and talking about
        them with your doctor may help you make more informed decisions. But, at
        this time, there are no known ways to prevent a brain tumor through
        lifestyle changes. Most of the time, the cause of a brain tumor is
        unknown. However, the following factors may raise a person’s risk of
        developing a brain tumor:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Age. Brain tumors are more common in children and older adults,
          although people of any age can develop a brain tumor.
        </li>
        <li>
          Sex. In general, men are more likely than women to develop a brain
          tumor. However, some specific types of brain tumors, such as
          meningioma, are more common in women.
        </li>
        <li>
          Home and work exposures. Exposure to solvents, pesticides, oil
          products, rubber, or vinyl chloride may increase the risk of
          developing a brain tumor. However, there is not yet scientific
          evidence that supports this possible link.
        </li>
        <li>
          Family history. About 5% of brain tumors may be linked to hereditary
          genetic factors or conditions, including Li-Fraumeni syndrome,
          neurofibromatosis, nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome, tuberous
          sclerosis, Turcot syndrome, and von Hippel-Lindau disease.
        </li>
        <li>Exposure to infections, viruses, and allergens.</li>
        <li>Electromagnetic fields.</li>
        <li>Race and ethnicity.</li>
        <li>Ionizing radiation.</li>
        <li>Head injury and seizures.</li>
        <li>N-nitroso compounds.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        For more detailed information about each risk factor, consult with your
        healthcare provider.
