<h1>Brain Tumors</h1>
<h2>Types of Brain Tumors</h2>
<p>
  A brain tumor, known as an intracranial tumor, is an abnormal mass of tissue in which cells grow and multiply uncontrollably, seemingly unchecked by the mechanisms that control normal cells. More than 150 different brain tumors have been documented, but the two main groups of brain tumors are termed primary and metastatic.
</p>

<h3>Primary Brain Tumors</h3>
<p>
  Primary brain tumors include tumors that originate from the tissues of the brain or the brain's immediate surroundings. Primary tumors are categorized as glial (composed of glial cells) or non-glial (developed on or in the structures of the brain, including nerves, blood vessels, and glands) and benign or malignant.
</p>
<p>
  Metastatic brain tumors include tumors that arise elsewhere in the body (such as the breast or lungs) and migrate to the brain, usually through the bloodstream. Metastatic tumors are considered cancer and are malignant.
</p>

<h3>Types of Benign Brain Tumors</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Chordomas</li>
  <li>Craniopharyngiomas</li>
  <li>Gangliocytomas, Gangliomas, and Anaplastic Gangliogliomas</li>
  <li>Glomus Jugulare Tumors</li>
  <li>Meningiomas</li>
  <li>Pineocytomas</li>
  <li>Pituitary Adenomas</li>
  <li>Schwannomas</li>
</ul>

<h3>Types of Malignant Brain Tumors</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Gliomas</li>
  <li>Astrocytomas</li>
  <li>Ependymomas</li>
  <li>Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM)</li>
  <li>Medulloblastomas</li>
  <li>Oligodendrogliomas</li>
</ul>

<h3>Other Types of Brain Tumors</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Hemangioblastomas</li>
  <li>Rhabdoid Tumors</li>
</ul>

<h2>Pediatric Brain Tumors</h2>
<p>
  Brain tumors in children typically come from different tissues than those affecting adults. Treatments that are fairly well-tolerated by the adult brain (such as radiation therapy) may prevent normal development of a child's brain, especially in children younger than age five.
</p>
<p>
  According to the Pediatric Brain Tumor Foundation, approximately 4,200 children are diagnosed with a brain tumor in the U.S. Seventy-two percent of children diagnosed with a brain tumor are younger than age 15. Most of these brain tumors grow in the posterior fossa (or back) of the brain. Children often present with hydrocephalus (fluid build-up in the brain) or the face or body not working properly.
</p>
<p>
  Some types of brain tumors are more common in children than in adults. The most common types of pediatric tumors are medulloblastomas, low-grade astrocytomas (pilocytic), ependymomas, craniopharyngiomas, and brainstem gliomas.
</p>

<h3>World Health Organization (WHO) Grading System</h3>
<p>
  The World Health Organization (WHO) has developed a grading system to indicate a tumor's malignancy or benignity based on its histological features under a microscope.
</p>
<p>
  Most malignant
  <ul>
    <li>Rapid growth, aggressive</li>
    <li>Widely infiltrative</li>
    <li>Rapid recurrence</li>
    <li>Necrosis prone</li>
  </ul>
