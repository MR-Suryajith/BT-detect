        <h2>Types of Brain Tumors</h2>
        <p>
          A brain tumor, known as an intracranial tumor, is an abnormal mass of
          tissue in which cells grow and multiply uncontrollably, seemingly
          unchecked by the mechanisms that control normal cells. More than 150
          different brain tumors have been documented, but the two main groups
          of brain tumors are termed primary and metastatic.
        </p>
        <h3>Primary Brain Tumors</h3>
        <p>
          Primary brain tumors include tumors that originate from the tissues of
          the brain or the brain's immediate surroundings. Primary tumors are
          categorized as glial (composed of glial cells) or non-glial (developed
          on or in the structures of the brain, including nerves, blood vessels,
          and glands) and benign or malignant.
        </p>
        <p>
          Metastatic brain tumors include tumors that arise elsewhere in the
          body (such as the breast or lungs) and migrate to the brain, usually
          through the bloodstream. Metastatic tumors are considered cancer and
          are malignant.
        </p>
        <h3>Types of Benign Brain Tumors</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Chordomas</li>
          <li>Craniopharyngiomas</li>
          <li>Gangliocytomas, Gangliomas, and Anaplastic Gangliogliomas</li>
          <li>Glomus Jugulare Tumors</li>
          <li>Meningiomas</li>
          <li>Pineocytomas</li>
          <li>Pituitary Adenomas</li>
          <li>Schwannomas</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Types of Malignant Brain Tumors</h3>

        <h2>Pediatric Brain Tumors</h2>
        <p>
          Brain tumors in children typically come from different tissues than
          those affecting adults. Treatments that are fairly well-tolerated by
          the adult brain (such as radiation therapy) may prevent normal
          development of a child's brain, especially in children younger than
          age five.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to the Pediatric Brain Tumor Foundation, approximately 4,200
          children are diagnosed with a brain tumor in the U.S. Seventy-two
          percent of children diagnosed with a brain tumor are younger than age
          15. Most of these brain tumors grow in the posterior fossa (or back)
          of the brain. Children often present with hydrocephalus (fluid
          build-up in the brain) or the face or body not working properly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some types of brain tumors are more common in children than in adults.
          The most common types of pediatric tumors are medulloblastomas,
          low-grade astrocytomas (pilocytic), ependymomas, craniopharyngiomas,
          and brainstem gliomas.

        <h3>World Health Organization (WHO) Grading System</h3>
        <p>
          The World Health Organization (WHO) has developed a grading system to
          indicate a tumor's malignancy or benignity based on its histological
          features under a microscope.
        </p>
        <p>Most malignant</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Rapid growth, aggressive</li>
          <li>Widely infiltrative</li>
          <li>Rapid recurrence</li>
          <li>Necrosis prone</li>
        </ul>
